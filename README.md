# Deep Reinforcment Learning Model for Self Driving in Amazon DeepRacer




## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for developing a deep learning model aimed at enabling autonomous driving capabilities. The primary goal is to create a model capable of driving based on image input. The trained model is then deployed onto an Amazon DeepRacer vehicle for real-world testing. The training environment utilized for this project is a simulation built in Unity.
This project is developed under FIT DataLab at CTU
