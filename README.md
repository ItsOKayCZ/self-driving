# Deep Learning Self Driving Model for Amazon DeepRacer
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for developing a deep learning model aimed at enabling autonomous driving capabilities. The primary goal is to create a model capable of driving based on video input. The trained model will be deployed onto an Amazon DeepRacer vehicle for real-world testing. The training environment utilized for this project is a simulation built in Unity.
This project is developed under FIT DataLab at CTU

## Features
- Utilizes deep reinforcement learning techniques for autonomous driving.
- Integration with Amazon DeepRacer platform.
- Simulation environment developed in Unity.
